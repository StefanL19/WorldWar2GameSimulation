The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the German 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. 
The attack was supported by intensive Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. 
The fighting degenerated into house-to-house fighting, and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. 
By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders 
back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River.
